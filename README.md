rmtabs: Replace tab characters in a file.
=========================================
rmtabs is a proudly over-engineered tool to count and optionally replace tab
characters in a file with spaces.  If the option "-i" is passed to rmtabs, the
input file is not preserved and is overwritten.

Usage
-----
    rmtabs [-i]  <files ...>

Building
--------
Run `make`
